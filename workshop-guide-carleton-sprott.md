# It's Time to Build: How Anyone Can Ship Real Products with AI

**Carleton University | AI Workshop for Sprott School of Business**
**January 26, 2026**

## The New Reality

> "There are no limits anymore. Anyone can do anything. The only limiting factors are agency and ambition.
>
> Never has a college degree, work experience, network, even the accumulation of knowledge been worth less.
>
> You can just ship things."
>
> — Guillermo Rauch (@rauchg), CEO of Vercel

This is not a prediction. This is happening right now.

## Who Am I?

My name is Joe Hu. I am a product person, not a software engineer.

Three months ago, I didn't know what a "pull request" was.

Today, I am building my first commercial product — a real application with:
- User authentication
- Payment processing
- Cloud infrastructure
- Production deployment

**I am a living example of what's possible.**

---

## What This Workshop Is About

I'm not here to teach you to code.

I'm here to show you that **you don't need to know how to code** to build real products.

The rules have changed.

## Three Truths for the AI Era

### Truth #1: You Can Now Build an Entire Product on Your Own

The old way:
- Have an idea
- Find a technical co-founder
- Raise money
- Hire engineers
- Wait months or years

The new way:
- Have an idea
- Open your laptop
- Build it yourself
- Ship it this week

**The barrier to entry has collapsed.**

A single person with the right tools can now accomplish what once required a team of 10.

---

### Truth #2: AI Is Powerful, But You Still Need Clear Planning

Here's what most people get wrong: They think AI is magic. They type vague requests and expect perfect results.

This doesn't work.

**The bottleneck is not AI's capability. It's your ability to articulate what you want.**

What works:
- Write down what you want BEFORE you talk to AI
- Be specific about your requirements
- Break big tasks into smaller pieces
- Document your decisions

AI amplifies your clarity. If your thinking is fuzzy, your results will be fuzzy.

---

### Truth #3: The Most Effective Way to Learn Is by Doing

You cannot learn to swim by reading a book about swimming.

You cannot learn to build products by watching tutorials forever.

**You learn by building. You learn by shipping. You learn by doing.**

Every successful builder I know started by making something — often something imperfect, often something small.

The first step is always the hardest. But that first step is also all it takes.

## What Does "Building" Actually Look Like?

Let's demystify this.

### What AI Can Help You Create

- **Websites**: Personal portfolios, landing pages, full web applications
- **Documents**: Reports, presentations, professional materials
- **Tools**: Automation scripts, data analysis, custom utilities
- **Products**: Real applications that solve real problems

### A Simple Mental Model

Think of AI as an extremely capable assistant who:
- Can write code in any programming language
- Can search the internet for information
- Can read and modify files on your computer
- Can run commands and see results
- Works 24/7 without getting tired

But this assistant needs you to:
- Tell them what to build
- Make decisions when there are choices
- Test if the result matches what you wanted
- Guide them when something goes wrong

**You are the director. AI is your production team.**

## The Process: From Idea to Reality

### Step 1: Start with What You Want (Not with AI)

Before you touch any AI tool, answer these questions:

1. **What problem am I solving?**
2. **Who is this for?**
3. **What does "done" look like?**
4. **What are the must-have features?**

Write this down. In plain language. Don't worry about technical terms.

Example:
> "I want a personal website that shows my resume, my projects, and a way for recruiters to contact me. It should look professional and work on phones. I want to update it myself without needing to code."

This simple paragraph is more valuable than hours of vague experimentation.

---

### Step 2: Let AI Help You Plan

Once you know what you want, AI can help you figure out how to build it.

The key technique: **Ask AI to ask you questions.**

When AI asks clarifying questions:
- Answer honestly (even "I don't know" is fine)
- Let AI suggest options when you're unsure
- Make decisions, even if they feel arbitrary

Remember: A decision made is better than endless deliberation.

---

### Step 3: Build Incrementally

Don't try to build everything at once.

**The Golden Rule: One piece at a time.**

Bad approach:
> "Build me an entire e-commerce website with user accounts, shopping cart, payment, inventory management, and admin dashboard."

Good approach:
> "First, let's create a simple page that displays three products with images and prices."

Start small. Verify it works. Add the next piece. Repeat.

---

### Step 4: Test With Your Own Eyes

AI can write code. AI can even test code.

But AI cannot see your screen through your eyes.

**Manual testing is essential.**

Ask yourself:
- Does this look right?
- Does this feel right?
- Would I use this myself?
- Would I show this to someone else?

Your judgment matters. Don't skip this step.

---

### Step 5: Iterate Based on Reality

Things will go wrong. This is normal.

When something breaks:
1. **Describe what you expected**
2. **Describe what actually happened**
3. **Share any error messages**
4. **Let AI investigate**

You don't need to understand the technical details. You just need to be a good communicator about what you observe.

## Why Personal Websites Matter for Your Career

Let me be specific about today's exercise.

A personal website is one of the most valuable career assets you can have:

**For job seekers:**
- Stand out from hundreds of identical resumes
- Show, don't just tell, what you can do
- Demonstrate initiative and technical comfort
- Own your professional narrative

**For entrepreneurs:**
- Establish credibility before you have a track record
- Test ideas quickly and cheaply
- Build an audience for future launches
- Practice the build-ship-iterate cycle

**For everyone:**
- Control your online presence
- Create a central hub for your work
- Learn the fundamentals of how the internet works
- Prove to yourself that you can build things

---

## Common Fears (And Why They're Unfounded)

### "But I don't know how to code"

You don't need to. I don't know how to code either. I ship products anyway.

### "What if I break something?"

You're working on your own computer, on your own project. There's nothing to break that can't be fixed. Every mistake is a learning opportunity.

### "Isn't this cheating?"

Is using a calculator cheating at math? Is using a word processor cheating at writing?

Tools amplify capability. Using the best available tools is smart, not cheating.

### "Won't AI take my job?"

AI won't take your job. **Someone using AI will take your job.**

Be the person using AI.

### "This seems too good to be true"

I understand the skepticism. I was skeptical too.

Then I built things. Real things. Things that work. Things that people use.

The proof is in the doing.

## The Mindset Shift

This is perhaps the most important section of this entire workshop.

### Old Mindset: Consumer

- Wait for someone else to build solutions
- Accept tools as they are given to you
- Believe "I'm not technical enough"
- Seek permission before attempting

### New Mindset: Builder

- Build solutions when you see problems
- Create the exact tools you need
- Believe "I can figure this out"
- Ask forgiveness, not permission

**The gap between consumers and builders is closing.**

The only thing separating you from shipping your first product is the decision to start.

## What We'll Build Today

In this workshop, we will transform this very document into a beautiful, polished personal website.

You will see:
1. How plain text becomes a real web page
2. How to communicate with AI effectively
3. How to test and refine results
4. How to deploy something live on the internet

**The document you're reading right now will become a live website by the end of this session.**

---

## Action Items After This Workshop

1. **Today**: Try building something small. Anything. A simple webpage. A document. Just start.

2. **This Week**: Identify one problem in your life that software could solve. Write down what a solution would look like.

3. **This Month**: Build that solution. Ship it. Share it with one person.

4. **This Year**: Look back and notice how far you've come.

## Final Thought

The tools exist. The knowledge is accessible. The barriers are gone.

**The only question is: Will you build?**

Every successful product, every successful company, every successful career started with someone deciding to make something.

Today is a good day to start.
