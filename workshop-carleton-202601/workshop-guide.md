## The New Reality

> "There are no limits anymore. Anyone can do anything. The only limiting factors are agency and ambition.
>
> Never has a college degree, work experience, network, even the accumulation of knowledge been worth less.
>
> You can just ship things."
>
> — [@RAUCHG](https://x.com/rauchg/status/1999898954427961611), CEO of Vercel

This is not a prediction. This is happening right now.

## Who Am I?

![Joe Hu](images/headshot-optimized.jpg)

My name is Joe Hu. I am a product person, not a software engineer.

I'm currently a student in Carleton's [Technology Innovation Management (TIM)](https://carleton.ca/tim/) program.

Three months ago, I didn't know what a "pull request" was.

Today, I am building my first commercial product — **Joe Speaking** — a real application with:
- User authentication
- Payment processing
- Cloud infrastructure
- Production deployment

![Joe Speaking](images/joe_speaking_icon.webp)

**Even though I haven't officially released the product yet, I've already landed 3 customers from Australia, Japan, and China.**

**I am a living example of what's possible.**

## AGI Ventures Canada Hacker House

This month, I'm at Ottawa's first **AGI Ventures Canada** Hacker House — building my first commercialized product alongside high-agency people who believe in shipping fast.

![AGI Ventures Canada - Think in years. Ship this weekend.](images/agi-ventures-canada.png)

The motto says it all: **"Think in years. Ship this weekend."**

## From Idea to Incorporation

After one full month of subscribing to **Claude Max**, I registered my first company:

![Certificate of Incorporation - JUST JOE TECHNOLOGIES INC.](images/just-joe-technologies-certificate.png)

A one-person company with **AI troops**!

Alpha test launching in 10 days — powered by Opus, Gemini, and OpenAI APIs.

**It's time to build.**

---

I'm here today to share what I've learned — because I believe anyone can do this.

---

## What This Workshop Is About

I'm not here to teach you to code.

I'm here to show you that **you don't need to know how to code** to build real products.

This is about something more fundamental: **the mindset shift from consumer to builder.**

The rules have changed.

**Everyone is going to have the power to do everything they want, starting from the digital world and then the physical.**

## 🎬 Live Demo: Watch This Document Transform Into a Website

> **⏱️ This demo runs ~15 minutes — sit back and witness the future of building.**

**Right now, you're looking at plain text.**

This markdown document — simple formatting, no colors, no layout, no interactivity — is about to become something completely different.

**The website you're viewing right now? We built it in ~15 minutes using this exact process.**

**In the next 15 minutes, you will witness:**

1. 📄 **This exact raw content** taken as input
2. 🎨 **AI designing** a complete, beautiful website
3. ⚡ **Code being written** in real-time
4. 🌐 **A live deployment** to the actual internet
5. 📱 **Mobile-responsive design** that works everywhere

**Why start with this?**

Because seeing is believing. I could tell you that anyone can build products with AI. But *showing* you — in real-time — is infinitely more powerful.

By the end of this demo, you'll understand:
- What AI can actually do
- How fast modern development can be
- Why the old barriers no longer exist

**Let's begin.**

### Demo Prompt (What I'm About to Say to AI)

> *This is the exact prompt I'll use — notice how it's written in plain English, not code:*

```
First, read and understand everything in the "workshop-carleton-202601" folder,
including this workshop guide and all images.

Then, use /frontend-design — think like a professional UI/UX designer
with expertise in modern web aesthetics, typography, and visual hierarchy.

I want you to transform this document into a stunning, beautiful, and aesthetic
website for people who couldn't attend this workshop to experience the content.

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
- Use this workshop guide (workshop-guide.md) as the complete source
- DO NOT compact or summarize any content — every section must appear on the website
- Preserve all images and integrate them beautifully into the design

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Create a modern, professional design that reflects innovation and accessibility
- Use the hero image (01-vibe-engineering-hero.png) prominently
- Ensure excellent typography and visual hierarchy
- Add smooth scrolling and subtle animations where appropriate
- Design must be mobile-responsive and work beautifully on all screen sizes

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Add proper metadata for social media sharing (Open Graph, Twitter cards)
- Set up favicon using the author's avatar
- Optimize for fast loading
- Ensure accessibility standards are met

AUTHOR INFORMATION TO INCLUDE:
- Website: hubeiqiao.com
- X/Twitter: @hubeiqiao
- LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/hubeiqiao

INTEGRATION:
- Find an appropriate place on the main page (index.html) to add a link or section
  for this workshop/sharing session so visitors can discover it

PROCESS:
1. First, review all available images in the images folder
2. Create a design plan before coding
3. If anything is unclear, ask me questions using "ask-questions-if-underspecified"
4. After building, use browser preview to verify the design
5. Check that all images display correctly and are appropriately sized
6. Verify mobile responsiveness

Please begin by reviewing the content and images, then present your design plan.
```

### Review Prompt (After Building)

> *After the website is built, use this prompt to review and refine:*

```
Please review the website design using /agent-browser and /frontend-design skills. Ensure the image sizes and colors look appropriate, and confirm the site works well on small screens.
```

### What to Watch For During the Demo

As AI works, notice:

- **The conversation** — I'm directing, not coding
- **The iterations** — Things don't have to be perfect first try
- **The speed** — What used to take days happens in minutes
- **The questions** — AI asks for clarification when needed
- **The result** — A real, deployed website

## Three Truths for the AI Era

### Truth #1: You Can Now Build an Entire Product on Your Own

The old way:
- Have an idea
- Find a technical co-founder
- Raise money
- Hire engineers
- Wait months or years

The new way:
- Have an idea
- Open your laptop
- Build it yourself
- Ship it this week

**The barrier to entry has collapsed.**

A single person with the right tools can now accomplish what once required a team of 10.

---

### Truth #2: AI Is Powerful, But You Still Need Clear Planning

Here's what most people get wrong: They think AI is magic. They type vague requests and expect perfect results.

This doesn't work.

**The bottleneck is not AI's capability. It's your ability to articulate what you want.**

![Write first, then use AI](images/05-raw-draft-statistics.png)

What works:
- Write down what you want BEFORE you talk to AI
- Be specific about your requirements
- Break big tasks into smaller pieces
- Document your decisions

AI amplifies your clarity. If your thinking is fuzzy, your results will be fuzzy.

---

### Truth #3: The Most Effective Way to Learn Is by Doing

You cannot learn to swim by reading a book about swimming.

You cannot learn to build products by watching tutorials forever.

**You learn by building. You learn by shipping. You learn by doing.**

Every successful builder I know started by making something — often something imperfect, often something small.

The first step is always the hardest. But that first step is also all it takes.

## What Does "Building" Actually Look Like?

Let's demystify this.

### The Tool: [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code)

![Claude Code Interface](images/claude-code-interface.png)

This is [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) — an AI coding assistant that runs in your terminal. You type what you want in plain English, and it writes the code, creates files, and runs commands for you.

### What AI Can Help You Create

- **Websites**: Personal portfolios, landing pages, full web applications
- **Documents**: Reports, presentations, professional materials
- **Tools**: Automation scripts, data analysis, custom utilities
- **Products**: Real applications that solve real problems

### A Simple Mental Model

Think of AI as an extremely capable assistant who:
- Can write code in any programming language
- Can search the internet for information
- Can read and modify files on your computer
- Can run commands and see results
- Works 24/7 without getting tired

But this assistant needs you to:
- Tell them what to build
- Make decisions when there are choices
- Test if the result matches what you wanted
- Guide them when something goes wrong

**You are the director. AI is your production team.**

---

## The Process: From Idea to Reality

### Step 1: Start with What You Want (Not with AI)

Before you touch any AI tool, answer these questions:

1. **What problem am I solving?**
2. **Who is this for?**
3. **What does "done" look like?**
4. **What are the must-have features?**

Write this down. In plain language. Don't worry about technical terms.

Example:
> "I want a personal website that shows my resume, my projects, and a way for recruiters to contact me. It should look professional and work on phones. I want to update it myself without needing to code."

This simple paragraph is more valuable than hours of vague experimentation.

---

### Step 2: Let AI Help You Plan

Once you know what you want, AI can help you figure out how to build it.

The key technique: **Ask AI to ask you questions.**

When AI asks clarifying questions:
- Answer honestly (even "I don't know" is fine)
- Let AI suggest options when you're unsure
- Make decisions, even if they feel arbitrary

Remember: A decision made is better than endless deliberation.

---

### Step 3: Build Incrementally

Don't try to build everything at once.

**The Golden Rule: One piece at a time.**

Bad approach:
> "Build me an entire e-commerce website with user accounts, shopping cart, payment, inventory management, and admin dashboard."

Good approach:
> "First, let's create a simple page that displays three products with images and prices."

Start small. Verify it works. Add the next piece. Repeat.

---

### Step 4: Test With Your Own Eyes

AI can write code. AI can even test code.

But AI cannot see your screen through your eyes.

**Manual testing is essential.**

Ask yourself:
- Does this look right?
- Does this feel right?
- Would I use this myself?
- Would I show this to someone else?

Your judgment matters. Don't skip this step.

---

### Step 5: Iterate Based on Reality

Things will go wrong. This is normal.

![AI responds to pushback](images/02-pushback-investigate-deeper.png)

When something breaks:
1. **Describe what you expected**
2. **Describe what actually happened**
3. **Share any error messages**
4. **Let AI investigate**

You don't need to understand the technical details. You just need to be a good communicator about what you observe.

---

## Your Challenge: Build Your Own Personal Website

After seeing this demo, here's what I suggest you try:

### Why a Personal Website?

A personal website is one of the most valuable career assets you can have:

**For job seekers:**
- Stand out from hundreds of identical resumes
- Show, don't just tell, what you can do
- Demonstrate initiative and technical comfort
- Own your professional narrative

**For entrepreneurs:**
- Establish credibility before you have a track record
- Test ideas quickly and cheaply
- Build an audience for future launches
- Practice the build-ship-iterate cycle

**For everyone:**
- Control your online presence
- Create a central hub for your work
- Learn the fundamentals of how the internet works
- Prove to yourself that you can build things

### Getting Started

You don't need to do this today. But consider this your homework:

1. **Write a simple description** of what you want your website to include
2. **Open an AI assistant** like [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) (free) or [Claude](https://claude.ai/) and paste your description
3. **Ask AI to help you plan** the structure
4. **Start building** one section at a time

The website you create doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to exist.

---

## Common Fears (And Why They're Unfounded)

### "But I don't know how to code"

You don't need to write code — but you do need to understand the fundamentals: how files are organized, how websites work, what a deployment means. Learn the workflow, not the syntax. And when you're stuck? Just ask AI. It will explain anything you don't understand.

### "What if I break something?"

Start small. Build something tiny first — a simple webpage, a basic form. You're working on your own computer, on your own project. There's nothing to break that can't be fixed. Git tracks every change, so you can always go back. Every mistake is a learning opportunity, and AI can help you understand what went wrong.

### "Isn't this cheating?"

Is using a calculator cheating at math? Is using a word processor cheating at writing?

Tools amplify capability. Using the best available tools is smart, not cheating.

### "Won't AI take my job?"

AI won't take your job. **Someone using AI will take your job.**

Be the person using AI.

### "This seems too good to be true"

I understand the skepticism. I was skeptical too.

Then I built things. Real things. Things that work. Things that people use.

The proof is in the doing.

---

## The Mindset Shift

This is perhaps the most important section of this entire workshop.

### Old Mindset: Consumer

- Wait for someone else to build solutions
- Accept tools as they are given to you
- Believe "I'm not technical enough"
- Seek permission before attempting

### New Mindset: Builder

- Build solutions when you see problems
- Create the exact tools you need
- Believe "I can figure this out"
- Ask forgiveness, not permission

**The gap between consumers and builders is closing.**

The only thing separating you from shipping your first product is the decision to start.

---

## From Document to Deployed Website

```
📄 Document  →  🤖 AI Builds  →  🐙 GitHub  →  ▲ Vercel  →  ✅ Live!
```

The deployment process is simpler than you think:

1. **Write your content** (like this document)
2. **Let AI build the website**
3. **Push to GitHub** (a free code hosting service)
4. **Deploy with Vercel** (free for personal projects)

Within minutes, your website is live. Real URL. Real website. Accessible to anyone in the world.

---

## Action Items After This Workshop

1. **Today**: Try building something small. Anything. A simple webpage. A document. Just start.

2. **This Week**: Write down what you want your personal website to include. Be specific about the sections and content.

3. **This Month**: Build that website. Ship it. Share it with one person.

4. **This Year**: Look back and notice how far you've come.
