## Main Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**

Just did a live demo at Carleton University.

Claude Code:
• 5 min planning
• 14 min coding
• 2,700+ lines written
• $5 total cost

Result: A complete website built from raw text. Zero lines written by hand.

The packed classroom watched it happen in real-time.

It's time to build.

**Tweet 2 (Context):**

Ran an AI workshop for undergrad students at Sprott School of Business.

The goal: Show that ANYONE can now ship real products.

I didn't have time to prep traditional slides. So I used Claude Code to turn my raw notes into a full workshop website — then demoed the exact same process live.

**Tweet 3 (The Challenge):**

Challenged every student to build their own personalized website.

Shared:
- My complete workflow
- The exact prompts
- The GitHub repo
- Step-by-step build process

All on the workshop page: https://cc.hubeiqiao.com/workshop-carleton-202601/

**Tweet 4 (The Vision):**

We're entering an era where everyone has the capacity to build whatever they want.

Starting digital. Then physical.

The barrier isn't technical skill anymore. It's imagination and willingness to start.

What will you build?

**Tweet 5 (Call to Action + Humor):**

.@AnthropicAI — Canadian students need more exposure to Claude and building with AI.

Ottawa students: connect with @AGIVentures_ to engage more with the local AI builder community.

(Though for students on free tier budgets, I did recommend Gemini to get started... sorry not sorry)

But when you're ready to ship seriously? Claude Code is unmatched.

## Alternative Single Tweet Version

Live demo at Carleton today:

Claude Code turned raw text into a 2,700+ line website in 19 minutes. Cost: $5.

A packed classroom watched it happen in real-time.

Everyone can build now. The question is — what will you create?

**Suggested video (if available):**
- Screen recording of the live demo would be incredibly powerful
