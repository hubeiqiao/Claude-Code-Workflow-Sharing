**It's Time to Build.**

Just wrapped up an incredible AI workshop at Carleton University's Sprott School of Business — sharing how anyone can ship real products with AI tools.

The highlight? A live demo that left a packed classroom in awe.

Here's what happened:
- Started with raw text documents and images
- Claude Code planned the architecture in 5 minutes
- Then ran autonomously for 14 minutes
- Result: 2,700+ lines of production-ready code
- A fully functional, beautifully designed website — built from scratch

Total cost: ~$5 with Opus 4.5.

The best part? I integrated this newly generated website into the workshop page right there, live. Students watched the entire process unfold in real-time.

This wasn't about showing off AI capabilities. It was about proving a point:

**Everyone now has the capacity to build whatever they want.** Starting from the digital world, then the physical world.

I challenged students to build their own personalized websites as their first project. Shared my complete workflow, prompts, and even the GitHub repo — all available on the workshop page.

To all the Canadian students I met today: the barrier to building has never been lower. The only question is — what will you create?

@Anthropic — Canadian students are hungry to learn about Claude and how to build with AI. Let's bring more workshops north of the border!

For students in Ottawa who want to engage more with the local AI community: check out @AGI Ventures Canada — great people building and shipping together.

(For those on a budget starting out, I recommended Gemini's free tier to get started — but when you're ready to ship seriously, Claude Code is unmatched.)
